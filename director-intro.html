              [Terms of Service]<br><br>  

              Chapter 1: General Provisions<br>

              1. These Terms shall take effect upon being publicly announced to users.<br>  
              2. The Clinic reserves the right to amend these Terms due to changes in circumstances or for significant business reasons. The amended Terms shall take effect in the same manner as described in the preceding clause.<br><br>

              Matters not specified in these Terms shall be governed by relevant laws and regulations.<br><br>  

              Chapter 2: Membership Registration and Service Use<br>  
              Article 1 (Definition of Members)<br>  
              A member is an individual deemed eligible for membership by the Clinic, who agrees to these Terms, completes the membership registration form, and is issued an "ID" and "password." <br><br>  

              Article 2 (Establishment of Service Subscription)<br>  
              1. Service subscription is established through the Clinic's acceptance of the user's application and the user's agreement to the Terms.<br>  
              2. Individuals wishing to become members and use the services must provide the personal information requested by the Clinic.<br>  
              3. Upon acceptance of a user's subscription application, the Clinic shall notify the user of their member ID and any other necessary information deemed relevant by the Clinic.<br>  
              4. The ID entered during registration cannot be changed, and only one ID will be issued per individual.<br>  
              5. The Clinic reserves the right to deny subscription applications in the following cases:<br><br>  

                a. If the application is submitted under someone else's name<br>  
                b. If the application form contains false information<br>

                3. Certain services, such as online consultations, may not be available 24 hours a day due to the personal circumstances of the consulting professional.<br><br>

                1. The service is available free of charge to all registered members.<br>

                2. During the withdrawal request, members must provide their name, resident registration number, ID, phone number, and reason for withdrawal to verify the information against the membership record before the cancellation is processed.<br>  
                3. Withdrawal is confirmed when login using the existing ID and password is no longer possible.<br><br>

                3. Re-registration is confirmed when login using the previous ID and password is restored.<br><br>  
                
                Article 3: Service Restrictions<br>  
                The Clinic reserves the right to terminate the service agreement or suspend service for a specified period without prior notice if members engage in any of the following activities:<br><br>

                ### Chapter 4: Disclaimer of Liability<br>  
                
                Article 1: Online Consultation<br>  
                1. The Clinic makes every effort to maintain the confidentiality of consultation content to prevent it from being disclosed to third parties other than the consulting professional and service administrators. However, the Clinic assumes no responsibility for the disclosure or loss of consultation content in the following cases:<br><br>  
                   a. When the user's negligence results in password leakage<br>  
                   b. When the user utilizes the "delete" function to remove the consultation<br>  
                   c. When consultation content is disclosed or lost due to natural disasters or other circumstances beyond the Clinic's control<br><br>  
                2. Primary physicians and specialists may review consultation content and responses to provide comprehensive and appropriate answers.<br>  
                3. Consultation content, after anonymization, may be used for the following purposes:<br><br>  
                   a. Academic activities<br>  
                   b. Publications, including printed materials or CD-ROMs<br>  
                   c. FAQs and recommended consultations as part of service content<br><br>  
                4. Consultation answers are subjective responses based on the medical knowledge of the consulting physician and do not represent the opinions of the Clinic.<br>  
                5. Consultations involving the following cases may be partially or entirely declined:<br><br>  
                   a. Repeated submission of the same consultation<br>  
                   b. Use of inappropriate language in consultation requests<br>  
                   c. Requests for specific diagnoses<br>  
                   d. Consultations about treatment costs, examination fees, or medication prices<br><br>  
                
                Article 2: Information Service<br>  
                1. The content provided through the service is general in nature and offered solely for informational purposes. The information and consultations provided through the service cannot replace medical diagnosis, care, or treatment. If you have health concerns, you should consult a qualified physician. Do not disregard or delay seeking medical advice based on information obtained from the service.<br>  
                2. The Clinic does not endorse any specific tests, products, or treatments mentioned in the service. Opinions expressed in the service are those of the consulting professionals and not the Clinic. The Clinic assumes no responsibility for any content or consultations provided through the service.<br>  
                3. Users accept all responsibility for using the information, opinions, and recommendations provided by the service. The Clinic shall not be liable for any damages, injuries, or other disadvantages resulting from the use of the service content, products, or instructions.<br><br>
