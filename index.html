The Clinic cannot prevent advertisers or related third parties from using cookies. Members or users who do not wish to have information collected via cookies may adjust their browser settings to accept or reject cookies. However, the use of cookies may be necessary for the proper functioning of certain services, especially personalized features.<br>

              Information entered by users for membership registration, etc., is destroyed immediately using the destruction methods described below after its purpose has been achieved.<br><br>  

              Destruction Method<br>  
              Personal information stored in electronic file format is deleted using technical methods that make the records irrecoverable. Personal information printed on paper is shredded or incinerated for destruction.<br><br>  

              8. Rights of Users and Legal Representatives and Methods of Exercise<br>  
              Membership registration for children under 14 years of age (hereinafter referred to as "children") is carried out through a separate form written in plain language that is easy for children to understand. Consent from the legal representative is mandatory when collecting personal information.<br><br>  

              To obtain the consent of the legal representative, the Clinic collects minimal information, such as the name and contact information of the legal representative, and secures consent following the procedures outlined in the Privacy Policy.<br><br>  

              Legal representatives of children can request access to, correction, or deletion of their child's personal information. To view, correct, or delete a child's personal information, the legal representative can click on "Edit Member Information" and go through the verification process or contact the personal information protection officer via mail, phone, or fax. Necessary actions will then be taken.<br><br>  

              The Clinic does not provide or share information about children with third parties. If the legal representative requests correction of errors in the child's personal information, the use and provision of such information will be suspended until the errors are corrected.<br><br>  

              9. Withdrawal of Consent / Membership Termination Methods<br>  
              You may withdraw your consent to the collection, use, and provision of personal information at any time during membership registration. Membership withdrawal can be processed by clicking "Membership Withdrawal" on the website or by contacting the personal information protection department via mail, phone, or fax. Necessary measures, including the destruction of your personal information, will be taken without delay.<br><br>  

              10. Installation, Operation, and Refusal of Automatic Personal Information Collection Devices<br>
